## Hi there 👋

👤 I am a frontend developer who works in the projects that created with micro frontend approach. I am using React, Svelte and also Lit-Elements to create web components. 

⏳ Nowadays, I am focused to best practices of large frontend applications like feature-driven project structures, testing mechanisms, component patterns.

📎 I also have knowledge about NestJS and Typescript API.

🤝 I like to contribute open source projects.
